            My name is Daniel Virgen Zamora, in this autobiography I want to tell
             you how my passion and interest for technology started, since my childhood 
             I have always been interested and curious about how things around me work, 
             these feelings increased when we talk about technology.
          </p>   
          <p className='bio'> I still remember myself
              almost destroying all my toys, just to know how and why they emitted light,
              made sounds or had movement, soon I discovered that it was due to the wonders of
              technology, thanks to that since I was little I had basic knowledge about electricity,
              magnetism and electric motors.
          </p> 
          
          <p className='bio'>I have always been fascinated by how and why
              things in this life work, which has led me to have an analytical, self-critical 
              and self-taught personality, all these factors eventually led me to have curiosity 
              about the Internet, my interest was no longer only in the hardware but had crossed to
              the software.
          </p> 
          
          <p className='bio'>that same curiosity led me to discover an app, which luckily offered 
              a bootcamp to learn web programming, I entered with the minimum knowledge in this 
              topic, I felt nervous about what I would experience, but today I completely thank 
              that decision I made, this experience has been completely gratifying for me, it has
              allowed me to learn many and very useful new skills, that will help me to develop
              professionally, I have learned how to develop web pages through HTML and languages 
              like CSS and Javascript, working environment such as React and structures such as
              Vite, I have made friends who have nourished my learning, the truth is I feel
              very happy for what I have achieved in my time in the bootcamp and I feel
              completely prepared to start applying my skills in a professional career.
